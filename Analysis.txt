# Calculate Big O

## Task0
Directly accessing the values using index so the time remains constant. 
Runtime Efficiency = O(1)

## Task1
We have one for loop at a time and the list will grow proportionally.
If statements would remain linear. 
Runtime Efficiency = O(n)

## Task2
There is a for loop nested inside of a for loop and the list will grow exponentially.
Runtime Efficiency = O(n^2)

## Task3
There is a for loop nested inside of a for loop and the list will grow exponentially.
Runtime Efficiency = O(n^2)

## Task4
There is a single for loop at a time and the list will grow proportionally.
If statements would remain linear. 
Runtime Efficiency = 0(n)
