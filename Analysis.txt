# Calculate Big O

## Task0
Directly accessing the values using index so the time remains constant. 
Runtime Efficiency = O(1)

## Task1
Containment inside of a for loop. 
Runtime Efficiency = O(n^2)

## Task2
Containment inside of a for loop, inside of a for loop.
Runtime Efficiency = O(n^3)

## Task3
Containment inside of a for loop, inside of a for loop.
Runtime Efficiency = O(n^3)

## Task4
5 levels of containment
Runtime Efficiency = 0(n^5)
